# Boardroom eLearning Samples

These are a collection of samples highlighting the usage of OpenTok in Learning Management Systems (LMS). Each demo deals with a small feature which are often seen in LMS applications.

The code for these samples can be found in the following subdirectories:

* [Proctoring](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-elearning-samples/proctoring) -- This application showcases an examiner who can see a zoom-able grid of examinees. Additionally, examinees can can share their cameras and screen.

* [Tutoring](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-elearning-samples/tutoring) -- This application involves one teacher connected to N number of students where the students can only see the teacher. The teacher can bring any student on the "stage" so that other students can see and hear that student. Additionally, the students also have a breakout room where they can discuss among each other.
